# Task 5: Network Traffic Capture Using Wireshark

## Objective:
Capture live packets and analyze common protocols.

## Tools:
- Wireshark

## Steps Followed:
1. Installed Wireshark.
2. Captured traffic for ~1 minute.
3. Browsed websites and used `ping` to generate traffic.
4. Stopped the capture and filtered protocols.

## Identified Protocols:
1. **TCP** – Reliable transport layer protocol.
2. **DNS** – Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
3. **HTTP** – Used for web page access.

## File Included:
- `network_capture.pcap` – Raw packet data from capture.

## Skills Learned:
- Using Wireshark
- Filtering and analyzing packet types
- Understanding common network protocols
